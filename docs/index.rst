Welcome to dionpy's documentation!
==================================

.. note::

   For a more in-depth review of the model, see `this work
   <https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/theses/bidula.pdf>`_. However, in contradistinction
   to the thesis, the newest version of Dionpy no longer separates the D-layer and F-layer of the ionosphere but
   performs raytracing of attenuation and refraction simultaneously.
